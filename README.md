# VGA
 This project uses the Zybo-Z7 board to show VGA patterns on a monitor and demonstrate logic debugging in Vivado by using ILA. This is done by using a VGA cable and a Pmod VGA to show patterns and using VIO, and ILA to monitor the status of 4 switches and buttons. 
 
## Description
For this project I set up an IP for clock wizard. I also added a constraint file that contains the VGA controls, button controls, and switch controls. Once that is set up, I then generate the bitstream, and program the device to test several different patterns.
